popmedia
========

Popmedia is an idea and project that I use at my house and want to provide to others.  The concept is simple: A transparent media server that uses apache with mongrel to expose directories to various different clients.  Using meta-data and the file-system alone (NO INDEXING, SCANNING, DATABASING, nothing, just the files and file system alone).  This make a much more friend experience because... you don't have to wait a year to see changes, or spend hours cleaning up bad scans.  Currently there is a working HTML client, with zip downloads and access to the servers administration, and a Roku client, with searching, BIF files, and meta-info viewing.
